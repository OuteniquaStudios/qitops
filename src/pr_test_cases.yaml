  title: Test error handling of the updated Starlette dependency in the application
  priority: Medium
  description: Verify that the updated version (0.40.0) of Starlette handles errors
    and exceptions gracefully, ensuring a good user experience even when unexpected
    situations occur.
  steps:
  - Create test scenarios where exceptional conditions are intentionally triggered
    within the application (e.g., by providing invalid inputs or forcing certain edge
    cases)
  - Observe how the updated Starlette dependency handles these exceptions and errors,
    checking for appropriate logging, error messages, and recovery mechanisms
  - ''
  expected_result: The updated Starlette dependency should handle errors effectively,
    providing descriptive error messages to help troubleshoot issues and maintaining
    application stability in the event of exceptional conditions. If any issues occur,
    they must be addressed before merging this update.
