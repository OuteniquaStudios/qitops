  steps:
  - Run the application with the updated Starlette dependency (0.40.0).
  - Use a tool like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan the application for potential
    security issues.
  - ''
  expected_result: The scanning tool should not report any critical or high-severity
    vulnerabilities related to the updated Starlette dependency. If any issues are
    found, they must be addressed before deploying the changes to the production environment.

    feature individually, paying close attention to any error messages or unexpected
    behavior.
  - ''
  expected_result: All existing features should function correctly after updating
    the Starlette dependency to version 0.40.0. If any issues are found, they must

  steps:
  - Introduce various types of errors (e.g., syntax errors, type errors) into the
    codebase where Starlette is used.
  - Verify that the application correctly handles these errors and does not crash
    or exhibit unexpected behavior.
  - ''
  expected_result: The updated Starlette dependency should handle errors gracefully,
    avoiding crashes and unexpected behavior in our application. If any issues are
    found, they must be addressed before deploying the changes to the production environment.
