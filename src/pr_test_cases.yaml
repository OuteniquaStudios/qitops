risk_analysis:
  level: Medium
  factors:
  - - Error handling changes
  - []
test_cases: " Based on the provided diff, it appears that a package named `axios`\
  \ has been updated from version 0.21.1 to version 0.28.0 in your project's dependencies.\
  \ This update is considered as Medium risk according to Snyk's risk analysis.\n\n\
  \   The factors contributing to this risk are:\n\n   1. Error handling changes:\
  \ The new version might handle errors differently than the previous one, which could\
  \ potentially introduce unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities in your\
  \ application. It is always recommended to carefully examine any updates that affect\
  \ error handling.\n\n   To mitigate this risk, consider the following steps:\n\n\
  \   1. Review the changelog and documentation for the updated version of `axios`\
  \ to understand what changes have been made. This can help you identify if there\
  \ are any potential issues related to error handling or other areas that could affect\
  \ your application.\n\n   2. Test the new version thoroughly in a controlled environment\
  \ before deploying it to production. This testing should include checking for any\
  \ regressions, security vulnerabilities, and unexpected behavior.\n\n   3. If you\
  \ find any issues during testing, consider raising them with the maintainers of\
  \ `axios` or submitting pull requests to fix them. Alternatively, you can wait for\
  \ subsequent updates that address these issues before upgrading.\n\n   By following\
  \ these steps, you can help ensure that the updated version of `axios` does not\
  \ introduce any unexpected risks or vulnerabilities in your application."
